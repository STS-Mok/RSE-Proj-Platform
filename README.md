# RSE-Proj-Platform #

Part of a series of successive project-based modules in Singapore Institute of Technology Bachelors in Engineering with Honours Robotic System Engineering Program.

This projects aims to obtain necessary capabilities in robotics for the contributor by working on the land-based platform.

## RSE 1101 ##

First module of the project started in Sep 2021, ended in Dec 2021.

This module aims to introduce and practice on various capabilities related to robotics, including doing enginnering design and fabrication, using electronics and coding basic autonomous behaviour.

The end product of this module demands a functional land-based, teleoperated, semi-autonomous mobile platform with obsticle detection.

## RSE 1202 ##

Second module of the project started in Jan 2022. Ended in Mar 2022.

Aims to further enhance capabilities and start to delve in industrial practices as well, taking note to safety functions and using checksum in commucation.

End product demands the platform from the previous module be able to do "follow me" function, navigate using mecanum wheels with more sensors for collision detection, and commucate with advanced features.
